## Crypto Clustering

## Background

With the role of an advisor at one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world, Competitors are fierce, so I want to propose a novel approach to assembling investment portfolios that are based on cryptocurrencies. Instead of basing your proposal on only returns and volatility, I want to include other factors that might impact the crypto market&mdash;leading to better performance for your portfolio.

So, creating a prototype for submitting crypto portfolio proposal to the company board of directors.

## Creation

Combining my financial Python programming skills with the new unsupervised learning skills that I have acquired.

### Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Data

1. Code the elbow method algorithm to find the best value for k. Use a range from 1 to 11.

2. Plot a line chart with all the inertia values computed with the different values of k to visually identify the optimal value for k.

3. Answer the following question: What is the best value for k?

### Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Data

1. Initialize the K-means model with four clusters by using the best value for k.

2. Fit the K-means model using the original data.

3. Predict the clusters to group the cryptocurrencies using the original data. View the resulting array of cluster values.

4. Create a copy of the original data and add a new column with the predicted clusters.

5. Using hvPlot, create a scatter plot by setting `x="price_change_percentage_24h"` and `y="price_change_percentage_7d"`. Color the graph points with the labels found using K-means. Then, add the crypto name in the `hover_cols` parameter to identify the cryptocurrency represented by each data point.

### Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis

1. Create a PCA model instance and set `n_components=3`.

2. Use the PCA model to reduce to three principal components. View the first five rows of the DataFrame.

3. Retrieve the explained variance to determine how much information can be attributed to each principal component.

4. Answer the following question: What is the total explained variance of the three principal components?

5. Create a new DataFrame with the PCA data. Be sure to set the `coin_id` index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame. Review the resulting DataFrame.

### Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data

1. Code the elbow method algorithm and use the PCA data to find the best value for k. Use a range from 1 to 11.

2. Plot a line chart with all the inertia values computed with the different values of k to visually identify the optimal value for k.

3. Answer the following questions: What is the best value for k when using the PCA data? Does it differ from the best k value found using the original data?

### Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data

1. Initialize the K-means model with four clusters by using the best value for k.

2. Fit the K-means model by using the PCA data.

3. Predict the clusters to group the cryptocurrencies by using the PCA data. View the resulting array of cluster values.

4. Create a copy of the DataFrame with the PCA data and add a new column to store the predicted clusters.

5. Using hvPlot, create a scatter plot by setting `x="price_change_percentage_24h"` and `y="price_change_percentage_7d"`. Color the graph points with the labels found using K-means. Then, add the crypto name in the `hover_cols` parameter to identify the cryptocurrency represented by each data point.

### Visualize and Compare the Results

1. Create a composite plot using hvPlot and the plus (`+`) operator to compare the elbow curve that you created to find the best value for k with the original data and the PCA data.

2. Create a composite plot using hvPlot and the plus (`+`) operator to compare the cryptocurrencies clusters using the original data and the PCA data.

3. Answer the following question: After visually analyzing the cluster analysis results, what is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data by using K-means?
